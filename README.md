## UX (User Experience) 
---
### Project Goals 
* To build a trivia question web app on anime and manga with multiple choice questions.

### User Goals

### User Stories

* As a **user**, I want to **have fun** without **interruptions from errors or bugs**.
* As a **user**, I want the **questions to be randomised** so I can come back to the **challenge with new questions** every-time. 
* As a **user**, should be able to have my **top score saved** to beat next time or challenge others to do so. 
* As a **user**, I would like to **know my progress** through the test in terms of **how much** of test **has been completed**.

### Site Owner Goals 
* As a **site owner**, to entertain and keep user coming back to take the challenge again to beat the top score.

### Design Choices 
---
**Fonts**
I looked for a simple and asthetically pleasing font to match typical holiday themes of relaxations and good times. I chose [Palanquin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Palanquin?category=Sans+Serif&sort=popularity&query=pa#standard-styles) for all texts and headers. 

**Colours**
I chose to use the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/f72585-b5179e-7209b7-560bad-480ca8-3a0ca3-3f37c9-4361ee-4895ef-4cc9f0) colour scheme generator to find one suitable for this project. Below is a screenshot of the colour scheme. They are colours that are pleasant and to look.

### Wireframing 

For **wireframing**, I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I used it to create **simple** wireframes 
showing the basic structure on which I built the website on. Some features maybe removed or added during 
development.
